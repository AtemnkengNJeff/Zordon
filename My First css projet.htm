<p  class="preface"> The person who i admire most is my father Mr Atemnkeng Nicodemus Fondungallah. To me is my mentor and i wish to follow him in footstep to even become greater then him so he will live a good life. Why i admire him so much is because he is a good man, he doesn't hesitate to take his cousins, nice, nephew under his roof so as to educate them to become greate people tommorow even though he knows he won't gain anything in return. Even in the village people recognises y father as a greate man and in other places such as his Office side they recognise him as greate man so that's why i wish to become a man greater than him through hard work so that he can be proud of me.
